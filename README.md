American Sign Language (ASL) is the primary mean of communication of people with hearing disabilities and it plays a crucial role in the Deaf community in the north America. Hence, recognition of ASL with computer algorithims is a continoius effort and challenge in the field of machine learning due to its complexity. In this project, more than 11,000 images of all ASL alphabets are preccessed, vectorized, and resized using Pillow, Numpy, and sklearn libraries. Then, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) is build and trained using all these processed images. 
Different features of CNNs architectures such as filters, hidden layers, and number of nurons are assessed in order to leverage the accuracy and F1-score metrics. The trained CNNs model recongize the train and test subsets with >98% of accuracy.
